Mechanics of Composite Materials with MATLAB

Introduction

This project involves the study and implementation of various mechanics of composite materials using MATLAB. The primary goal is to utilize MATLAB as a matrix calculator for performing the necessary numerical calculations in the mechanics of composite materials. This project emphasizes step-by-step solutions to mechanical problems, enhancing the understanding of composite material mechanics computations.

The MATLAB scripts provided in this repository are based on the book "Mechanics of Composite Materials with MATLAB" by George Z. Voyiadjis and Peter I. Kattan. The book focuses on linear elastic behavior in structural mechanics and includes a variety of examples and problems solved using MATLAB.

Project Overview

The project includes MATLAB functions specifically written to analyze fiber-reinforced composite materials. The functions are designed to handle various tasks such as calculating compliance and stiffness matrices, lamina analysis in local and global coordinate systems, and failure theories of a lamina.

Key Features
Comprehensive MATLAB Functions: The project includes 44 special MATLAB functions provided as M-files, which are used to perform calculations specific to the mechanics of composite materials.
Step-by-Step Problem Solving: Each problem is solved in a detailed manner, focusing on understanding the mechanics computations rather than just providing ready-made solutions.
Interactive MATLAB Sessions: The MATLAB examples are conducted in the form of interactive sessions, allowing users to follow along and understand each step of the computation.
Educational Focus: The project is designed primarily for students and professionals interested in learning the mechanics of composite materials through practical MATLAB implementations.
Project Structure

The project is organized into several key sections:

MATLAB Functions: A comprehensive set of MATLAB functions used throughout the project.
Examples: Detailed examples demonstrating both the theory and numerical computations.
Problems and Solutions: A series of problems provided at the end of each chapter, with solutions to reinforce learning.
